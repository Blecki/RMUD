Lighthouse Lobby

Cabernet wood trim accent the walls and [hearth] of the Lighthouse Lobby, matching the picture frames 
featuring moody scenes of proud sailing ships that seem to beckon you to a life at sea. Nestled against 
one side of the hearth is a small oak desk that hosts piles of [maps] and charts, and a rather imposing 
marine band [radio], accompanied by a puffy looking red leather chair. A single large window sits open to 
the west, letting in the cool ocean air and sounds of the sea. There is a landing for a spiral staircase 
in the middle of the room.

Exits:
South - Sandy Shoreline
Up - Spiral Stairs

//objects
hearth - it's certainly large enough to heat this small room, but looks unused for some time.
maps - there is a map of the island and a few depth and current charts
radio - you hear a droning tin voice repeating weather data
