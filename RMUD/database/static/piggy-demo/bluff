Rocky Bluff

You follow the storm-worm fence to rougher terrain. The rocks here are slick with sea spray, and
offer the quiet threat of hard edges. A few birds wait patiently for fish to get dashed against the 
rocks. A dark stain mars the surface of some rocks below the bluff, but it's hard to tell what may
have left it there. You notice a small [silver locket] and [cigarette butts] near a flat rock. It 
looks like someone may have been sitting there.

Exits:
West - Sandy Shore

silver locket - it's covered in dirt, but there is a photo inside of an older woman in a green dress
cigarette butts - there are many, but only one has lipstick on the filter
