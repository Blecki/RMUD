Sandy Shoreline

The sand here rough and littered with small stones that dot the areas between clumps of vegitation. A cool
breeze feels clean on your skin as the ebb and flow of the sea hypnotizes you with it's rythmic white noise. 
Part of an old [fence] is here, leading East to a Rocky Bluff.  There is a Lighthouse to the north, and a 
Fishing Shack to the south.

Exits:
North - Lighthouse Lobby
East - Rocky Bluff
South - Fishing Shack

fence - The small wood stakes are held together by wire. This is the only part standing. Looks like the rest
        has been destroyed by winds.
