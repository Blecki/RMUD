Cabin on the Boat

The windows have a slight film on them, perhaps from smoke. There's a fish finder with a cracked
screen mounted on the throttle housing. A compass bobs dispassionately above the rudder wheel, 
pointing to North at your back. The [keys] dangle in the ignition, showing off a small photo keychain
with a woman's [picture] in it. There is a marine band [radio] mounted to the roof, keeping watch
over a small folder of [maps]. 

Exits:
North - Boat Deck

//objects
keys - they seem to be stuck in the ignition
picture - the woman looks to be in her mid-40's, wearing a conservative green dress.
radio - you flip the power on, but only hear the whisper of static
maps - there is a map of the island, and some depth charts of the the surrounding ocean
