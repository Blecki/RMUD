Deck of a Docked Boat

A few old tires cling to the side of the boat, bumping gently against the dock. The deck of the boat
is stained with a strange oily substance and emits a high creak as soon as you step on it. Some of the 
rails are starting to rust, and you notice a [tackle box] strapped to one. There is an old [first aid kid]
encased in dingy plastic mounted on a rotting sideboard. The boat floats, but it has seen better days. You 
wonder if the motor runs. Its cabin sits south, pointing out to sea. 

Exits: 
East - Small Shack
South - Boat Cabin

tackle box - A few lures and hooks. Not much of interest.
first aid kit - It seems to have never been opened. You wonder if this could come in handy.
