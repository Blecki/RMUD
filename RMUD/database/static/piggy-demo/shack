Small Shack

The proud, sturdy walls display battle scars from the elements. There are a few [fishing poles] leaning
against one corner of the shack, and a [lobster trap] in another. A small table is near the trap, showing 
evidence of the day's catch having been cleaned upon it. A slight aroma of fish hangs in the air. There is a 
boat docked outside to the west.

Exits:
North - Sandy Shore
West - Docked Boat

fishing poles - They look old, but durable. 
lobster trap - The frame seems to be bent. You wonder if it is usable.
