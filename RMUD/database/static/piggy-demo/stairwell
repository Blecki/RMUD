Spiral Staircase

As you climb the mesh metal stairs, you notice another large window facing South to the sea, interrupting
a string of elegantly framed photographs that depict the lighthouse's history. One features a small ribbon
cutting ceremony, and the others are shots of visitors or the workers. Perhaps this once attracted tourists
in the days before electronic navigation. A platform looms above you. 

Exits:

Down - Lighthouse Lobby
Up - Lantern Room
