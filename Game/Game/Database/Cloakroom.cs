"The walls of this small room were clearly once lined with hooks, though now only one remains.
The exit is a door to the east."

In the Cloakroom is a supporter called the small brass hook.
The hook is scenery. Understand "peg" as the hook.

[Inform will automatically understand any words in the object definition
("small", "brass", and "hook", in this case), but we can add extra synonyms
with this sort of Understand command.]

The description of the hook is "It's just a small brass hook,
[if something is on the hook]with [a list of things on the hook]
hanging on it[otherwise]screwed to the wall[end if]."

[This description is general enough that, if we were to add other hangable items
to the game, they would automatically be described correctly as well.]
