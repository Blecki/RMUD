### A Brief History
*RMUD* is an open-source, community project initially conceptualized on the __[MUD subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/MUD)__ in 2014. Garnering enough interest, several now core members came together and work began on creating a game that was something different from all the high-fantasy in the genre, opting for the less popularized __[Fantastique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastique)__ genre.

### Interested in Helping?
Glad to hear! There is plenty to be done! 

At this point in time, *RMUD* is still in a pre-alpha state. The engine that will power our game is not based off an existing codebase, instead being built from scratch in C#. We do not have a set road-map *yet*, but plenty of issues are currently waiting to be tackled. Feel free to hop in any of the threads and offer ideas or help. If you are more interested in programming, feel free to fork the repo and start hacking away! More information on the code can be found __[here](https://github.com/Trevoke/let-us-write-a-mud/issues/2)__.

Anything else, feel free to ask!

A road-map and task-list will be up within the coming weeks.
