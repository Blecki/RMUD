# RMUD *(title pending)*

---
### A Brief History
*RMUD* is an open-source, community project initially conceptualized on the [MUD subreddi]t(http://reddit.com/r/MUD) in 2014. Garnering enough interest, several now core members came together and work began on creating a game that was something different from all the high-fantasy in the genre, opting for the less popularized [Fantastique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastique).

### Interested in Helping?
Glad to hear! There is plenty to be done! 

At this point in time, *RMUD* is still in a pre-alpha state. The engine that will power our game is not based off an existing codebase, instead being built from scratch in C#. We do not have a set road-map *yet*, but we have a couple issues opened here in the repo that discuss current tasks, especially world-building, in length.  Feel free to hop in any of the threads and offer ideas or help, and if you just want direction, there is a [TASK] currently open [here](https://github.com/Trevoke/let-us-write-a-mud/issues/5) that we need to finish. If you are more interested in programming, feel free to fork the repo and start hacking away! More information on the code can be found [here](https://github.com/Trevoke/let-us-write-a-mud/issues/2).

Anything else, feel free to ask!

A road-map and task-list will be up within the coming week.
